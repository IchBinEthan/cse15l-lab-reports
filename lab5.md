# Lab Report 5 -- Debugging

For this Lab Report, I cite Emi Van Cleave for collaboration on getting started with Part 1. Props to Emi. :)

## THE REPORT

 `Edstem report. Student: Doe, Jonathan`
 
 
 
 `What environment are you using (computer, operating system, web browser, terminal/editor, and so on)?`

I am using Macbook Pro with M1, with Visual Studio Code as my IDE.

`Detail the symptom you’re seeing. Be specific; include both what you’re seeing and what you expected to see instead. Screenshots are great, copy-pasted terminal output is also great. Avoid saying “it doesn’t work”.`

I am looking at the code for Skill Demo 2 and I am trying to fix ``grade.sh``. I have not made much progress, since I am failing the test.

## THE (new) TA RESPONSE

### Part 2: Reflection

Honestly, this quarter was really tough. I struggled really badly this quarter, and I had a lot of personal issues. I have a lot of trouble integrating into the community of Computer Science. My take might be  negative, but to be honest, so is the environment I'm in. I am grateful for making friends such as Melanie Haro and Emi Van Cleave, who have been in my group for many lab sections. Other than that, I think a break from this is long overdue.
