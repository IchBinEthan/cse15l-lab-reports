# Lab Report 1

Hi friends of CSE 15L! This is a tutorial for all of you to log into a course-specific account on ieng6.

Step 0 -- Have an ieng6@ucsd.edu account to begin with. Please make sure you have one to connect with; 
If not, ask your TA for help in registering. 

Step 1 -- Install Visual Studio code. We can do this by going onto https://code.visualstudio.com/ and clicking the link to download the application based on the operating system you are using. For instance, I am a mac user (yeah, yeah, I know!) so I downloaded the app suitable for my mac.

Step 2 -- Remotely Connect. Before starting, there is an extra step for any Windows user. They must need to get 'git' for Windows which proivdes some useful tools: Link to the package can be found [here](https://ucsd-cse15l-s23.github.io/week/week1/#week-1-lab-report:~:text=tools%20we%20need%3A-,Git%20for%20Windows,-Once%20installed%2C%20use). After installing, they can set the default terminal to use the 'git bash' in the app.

We start by opening a terminal and typing the command 'ssh' then typing in our email to log in. Recall that the email address for the course-specific account is the username + "@ieng6.ucsd.edu". For instance, my username is "cs15lsp23gs", therefore I type the following: "ssh cs15lsp23gs@ien6.ucsd.edu".

This is to connect to the server, which will then give us a prompt to continue connecting. It will then ask us to unput your password. Once given, we should be able to connect remotely to the server!

Step 3 -- Run Commands! We are able to run commands into the terminal after logging in. Use some useful commands that are provided in the write-up for the lab, or the ones in the class lectures! Here are some examples of me running code.

// Note to TA's regarding images. I was able to upload them on initally, but I had given them invalid names on accident -- when making the URL's to embed them in, it wouldn't work, so I had them deleted. Multiple times have I tried to re-upload files into the lab report with different names, but I have been unsuccessful in trying to get them to upload. The only thing I can offer is a google drive to the images, which can be found [here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1X3LLLm9jO8uWpxFqQIx8QFXQY_RNZlr2).
